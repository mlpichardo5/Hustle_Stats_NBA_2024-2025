# Hustle_Stats_NBA_2024-2025
While basketball coaches preach a variety of different concepts, one is consistently harped on at all levels: hustle. Coaches love players that “do the little things”, such as playing hard defense, boxing out, and grabbing loose balls. Unfortunately, players that hustle in the NBA fly under the radar of the public eye. We hypothesize that there is an association between hustling and winning in the league. By conducting data analysis on the NBA’s hustle stats, we plan on shining a light on the important attributes of hustling in the NBA, and bring certain players to the forefront that exhibit strong tendencies to hustle, all through a statistical lens.
